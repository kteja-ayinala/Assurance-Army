# Motivation

The primary constarints we had to identify the scope while choosing a project is 

(a)the language a project is developed on,
(b)the possibility of  security issues,
(c)the current hit rate and scope of the project.

Refering to the first constraint (a), 
Nuxeo platform,  is a project developed using Java. Every person in the team is more or less comfortable with Java. The server side code is Java and for Web UI it uses javascript.

Refering to the second constraint (b),
The project offers security for the documents and the content.There are various kinds of permissions to stakeholders(User-level permissions/ Group-level permissions) either to read, edit or both. We believe this kind of permissions may provide us a chance to assure the security of content.

Refering to the third constraint (c),
The project is active, with decent number pull requests, releases and commits. The project has very detailed documentation, which helps us as a guide throuh out the project.
