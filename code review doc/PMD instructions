 Go here https://pmd.github.io/#downloads
 
 Click Download (it's under the GITHUB button, between Release Notes and Documentation)
 
 Unzip it somewhere. 
 
 Also download and unzip the Nuxeo project from Github
 
 Open the command line
 
 Go to the bin file of PMD <cd C:\Users\KirbyPC\Downloads\pmd-bin-6.9.0 (1)\pmd-bin-6.9.0\bin>
 
 It has 3 parts. Run pmd.bat, source file, format, ruleset
 
 Type:         .\pmd.bat -d <source> -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml
 
 Replace <source> with the path to the Nuxeo source file. It cannot be directly to the java file, but works for the folder that the java file is located in
